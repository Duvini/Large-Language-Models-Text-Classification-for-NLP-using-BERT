## Contents

1. **IMDB_text_classification.ipynb**  
   - This notebook demonstrates text classification using machine learning models. Specifically, it classifies movie reviews from the IMDB dataset into positive or negative sentiments.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Preprocessing of text data.
     - Feature extraction using techniques like Bag of Words or TF-IDF.
     - Training and evaluation of models such as Logistic Regression or Support Vector Machines.
     - Performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.

2. **NLP_tasks_with_Transformers.ipynb**  
   - This notebook explores a variety of NLP tasks using transformer models from the Hugging Face Transformers library.
   - **Key Features**:
     - Text classification with transformer-based models.
     - Named Entity Recognition (NER).
     - Question Answering.
     - Text summarization and generation.
     - Integration of pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, and T5.
